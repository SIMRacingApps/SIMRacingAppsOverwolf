<h2>Want to try it out? It's simple.</h2>
<h3>On the same computer where the simulator is running:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Download the latest version of SIMRacingAppsServer....exe from 
    <a href='http://simracingapps.com'>SIMRacingApps.com</a> 
    and save it where you can find it later. 
    It is not an installer.</li>
<li>Execute SIMRacingAppsServer....exe. </li>
<li>If you don't have Java 1.8 or better installed, 
    it will direct you to the download page so you can install Java.
    After Java is installed, execute the SIMRacingAppsServer....exe again. 
</li>
<li>Leave this window open while racing. 
    You can minimize it, but note the HTTP://... address in the title of this window first. 
    You will use this address to connect to the server from the client.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Clients can connect from any device connected to your home network<br />(including the SIM computer):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open a browser (Chrome, FireFox, IE10, EDGE, Safari) and enter the HTTP address of the server.</li>
<li>Click on one or more Apps or Widgets and start racing. Clicking the description will open the documentation for that App or Widget.</li>
<li>For detailed documentation, see the link above. 
    For a specific version, start that version's server and access the documentation from the main menu.

</ul>
